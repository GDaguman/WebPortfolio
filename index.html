            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>I'm from Calbayog City, Western Samar Philippines. I've always been curious about how technology shapes our daily lives, and that is i found my self constantly exploring the latest advancementa that can eager me to understand the mechanics behind this course.</p>
            <br>
            <p>motivated IT graduate who is passionate about using technology to encourage creativity and overcome challenging issues. My goal is to constantly improve my data analysis, cybersecurity, and software development abilities so that I can work well in dynamic teams and produce solutions that have a positive process impact and spur business expansion. I'm dedicated to keeping up with new developments in technology and fashion, as well as to creating a welcoming, friendly job environment that encourages innovation and high standards. </p>
            <br>
            <p>As a recent graduate in information technology, my path into the field was influenced not only by the courses I took but also by life events that inspired my passion for creativity. I learnt to be resourceful and innovative with the minimal technological tools I had growing up in a home with restricted access to contemporary technology. This grabbed my interest and motivated me to learn how things functioned, so I started investigating programming languages and learning the complexities of computer systems on my own. <br> One particular experience stands out vividly in my memory: the day my family's laptop crashed, causing us to lose precious memories stored in digital form. My family's suffering as a result of this emergency motivated me to study data recovery methods and how to avoid similar situations in the future. I spent several hours researching and testing until I was able to restore our lost data and put strong backup plans in place to guard against similar incidents in the future. <br> This personal anecdote serves as a continual reminder of how technology affects real-world situations and how crucial it is to protect digital assets. It stokes my enthusiasm for data security and cybersecurity, motivating me to seek specialist education and certifications in these areas.</p>
